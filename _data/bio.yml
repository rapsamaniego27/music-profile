      title: How It Started
      description: >-
        It all started in my theatre workshop days in Repertory Philippines back
        in 2002. I was exposed to these Musicals and Broadway songs because of
        my Mother who was also Theatre and Vocal coach at the time. I did shows
        like the Lion King, Once on This Island, Mamma Mia and Thirteen the
        Musical, just to name a few.

        <br><br>

        When I reached 12 years old, Christmas Day on 2007. My mother bought me a Blue Nylon guitar from RJ Music store. At first, I didn't know what to do with it because I had no background whatsoever. But then we visited my Uncle Manny in Manila to teach me the basic Chords (D, G, A, C,E). I couldn't see the sense of the chords until I heard him play guitar in front of me using the said chords. As far as I remember he was playing a Spanish tune.

        <br><br>

        Once I got to learn a few chords, I got so overjoyed and had to learn chords of songs I enjoy listening to. Just like any other beginner, I had to stop on one song because of it's complexity and had to choose an easier one. At some point I had to stop for months, it was an on and off experience for me learning the guitar as I only had one lesson from my Uncle. I can't say also to myself that I'm self taught, I still manage to meet up with my Uncles just to have one day of special lessons. So it's like 80% self taught and 20% from personal and online tutorials.

        <strong>Guitar</strong> was my first ever instrument to learn which up
        to this day still trying to improve myself with it. My first guitar was
        named NEON and spray painted it with Neon Green, which I still regret.
        Almost every guitar technique I've learned came from practicing with
        that guitar from strumming, to plucking, to fingerpicking, to simple
        guitar picking.

        <br><br>

        I <a href="#" target="_blank">struggled</a>  to pick songs that was right for me and my guitar. I struggled with what techniques to master and had no direction whatsoever. But I still managed to play somewhat at a level I could jam with my former classmates in High School.

        <br><br>

        In *2016*, I purchased my first career acoustic guitar called Crisanta. It wasn't too hard to press and wasn't so soft also that the tone could suffer. And every performance I join, Crisanta is always my go to Guitar to perform with.

        <br><br>

        In 2017, I bought my first violin which I named Alice. Just when I thought that learning guitar is hard. The violin is harder. It's such a blind instrument you had to really start from the basics from forms and positions to applicable techniques. Luckily without bargaining, I was able to go through learning it with my experience with the guitar and by having a sound sensitive ear to guide me on what I need to press on the fingerboard.
