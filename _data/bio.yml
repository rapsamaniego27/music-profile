      title: How It Started
      description: >-
        It all started in my theatre workshop days in Repertory Philippines back
        in 2002. I was exposed to these Musicals and Broadway songs because of
        my Mother who was also Theatre and Vocal coach at the time. I did shows
        like the Lion King, Once on This Island, Mamma Mia and Thirteen the
        Musical, just to name a few.

        <br><br>

        When I reached 12 years old, Christmas Day on 2007. My mother bought me a Blue Nylon guitar from RJ Music store. At first, I didn't know what to do with it because I had no background whatsoever. But then we visited my Uncle Manny in Manila to teach me the basic Chords (D, G, A, C,E). I couldn't see the sense of the chords until I heard him play guitar in front of me using the said chords. As far as I remember he was playing a Spanish tune.

        <br><br>

        Once I got to learn a few chords, I got so overjoyed and had to learn chords of songs I enjoy listening to. Just like any other beginner, I had to stop on one song because of it's complexity and had to choose an easier one. At some point I had to stop for months, it was an on and off experience for me learning the guitar as I only had one lesson from my Uncle. I can't say also to myself that I'm self taught, I still manage to meet up with my Uncles just to have one day of special lessons. So it's like 80% self taught and 20% from personal and online tutorials.

      description: >-
        <strong>Guitar</strong> was my first ever instrument to learn which up
        to this day still trying to improve myself with it. My first guitar was
        named NEON and spray painted it with Neon Green, which I still regret.
        Almost every guitar technique I've learned came from practicing with
        that guitar from strumming, to plucking, to fingerpicking, to simple
        guitar picking.

        <br><br>

        I <a href="#" target="_blank">struggled</a>  to pick songs that was right for me and my guitar. I struggled with what techniques to master and had no direction whatsoever. But I still managed to play somewhat at a level I could jam with my former classmates in High School.

        <br><br>

        In *2016*, I purchased my first career acoustic guitar called Crisanta. It wasn't too hard to press and wasn't so soft also that the tone could suffer. And every performance I join, Crisanta is always my go to Guitar to perform with.

        <br><br>

        In 2017, I bought my first violin which I named Alice. Just when I thought that learning guitar is hard. The violin is harder. It's such a blind instrument you had to really start from the basics from forms and positions to applicable techniques. Luckily without bargaining, I was able to go through learning it with my experience with the guitar and by having a sound sensitive ear to guide me on what I need to press on the fingerboard.

          description: >-
            New Wave was the very first genre I fell in love with. I was
            originally influenced by my Mom as I listened to Madonna, Cindy
            Lauper, A-ha, The Cure, The Police, just to name a few. 

            <br><br>

            My Uncle Jojo was also crazy over New Wave music so I got some of his stuff from him and was jamming with him to play most 80s stuff. 

            <br><br>

            At the time, the game "Guitar Hero" was a thing and we had this version of the game that played to 80s tracks which got me more excited and motivated to learn guitar, despite the genre being keyboard focused, I was always feeling hype into listening to these type of music.

        - title: Classical
          description: "Classical Music was more like a come and go genre for me as I only
            get to enjoy it occasionally. I would only get to play it when I
            feel like it, but the lack of techniques I possessed and the
            complexity of the music style always leads me to give up easily and
            come back again when I feel like I'm ready to play it.\

            My Mom was a classically trained singer in UST. Since I
            was a kid, besides her new wave tracks, she'd play some classical
            ones as well mostly from Bach and one of her favorite pieces \"Canon
            in D\" by Pachelbel.\ 

            <br><br>\r

            \r

            I loved some of the Classical stuff so much I had to
            force myself to learn one by ear. And that is \"Minuet in G Major\"
            by Bach which I learned in High School of 2009 and \"Canon\" in
            2010."

          add_description: "By 2011 I was enrolled in Guitar Lessons in Greenhills to
            learn to read notes. It didn't last very long and I forgot almost
            everything I learned reading notes, but my Guitar Teacher ,Phil
            taught me to have discipline on plucking the strings alternately
            instead of having to pluck twice or thrice with one finger on a
            string.\r

            He also taught me how to shape your fingernails properly
            into producing a nice guitar string sound on a Nylon Guitar with the
            use of Nail Filers and Nail Buffers.

            <br><br>\r

            \r

            When Covid started and implementing lockdowns in 2020,
            since gigs weren't available I was able to start playing Classical
            Music again but on the Violin. If learning Violin by ear was already
            a pain to you, it was even harder for me to play it while I read the
            notes on the music sheet. I usually pick up the flow of the piece by
            ear and had it memorized, which made it challenging for me as I had
            to train myself to play the piece as written in the sheet and not
            what is based on my memory. But eventually I was over that and got
            to do at least the basics of sightreading which nurtured my violin
            playing a bit more.\r

            \r

            I love Classical Music but I believe it's far too late
            now to be indulged in it as I was already enrolled in a Computer
            Science Degree in College. And the best thing I could do is learn
            the basics and appreciate where Beautiful music of today really came
            from."
