      title: How It Started
      description: >-
        It all started in my theatre workshop days in Repertory Philippines back
        in 2002. I was exposed to these Musicals and Broadway songs because of
        my Mother who was also Theatre and Vocal coach at the time. I did shows
        like the Lion King, Once on This Island, Mamma Mia and Thirteen the
        Musical, just to name a few.

        <br><br>

        When I reached 12 years old, Christmas Day on 2007. My mother bought me a Blue Nylon guitar from RJ Music store. At first, I didn't know what to do with it because I had no background whatsoever. But then we visited my Uncle Manny in Manila to teach me the basic Chords (D, G, A, C,E). I couldn't see the sense of the chords until I heard him play guitar in front of me using the said chords. As far as I remember he was playing a Spanish tune.

        <br><br>

        Once I got to learn a few chords, I got so overjoyed and had to learn chords of songs I enjoy listening to. Just like any other beginner, I had to stop on one song because of it's complexity and had to choose an easier one. At some point I had to stop for months, it was an on and off experience for me learning the guitar as I only had one lesson from my Uncle. I can't say also to myself that I'm self taught, I still manage to meet up with my Uncles just to have one day of special lessons. So it's like 80% self taught and 20% from personal and online tutorials.

        <br><br>

        I am Rap and I hope you enjoy my stories and experiences as you scroll down this page.

        <strong>Guitar</strong> was my first ever instrument to learn which up
        to this day still trying to improve myself with it. My first guitar was
        named NEON and spray painted it with Neon Green, which I still regret.
        Almost every guitar technique I've learned came from practicing with
        that guitar from strumming, to plucking, to fingerpicking, to simple
        guitar picking.

        <br><br>

        I <a href="#" target="_blank">struggled</a>  to pick songs that was right for me and my guitar. I struggled with what techniques to master and had no direction whatsoever. But I still managed to play somewhat at a level I could jam with my former classmates in High School.

        <br><br>

        In *2016*, I purchased my first career acoustic guitar called Crisanta. It wasn't too hard to press and wasn't so soft also that the tone could suffer. And every performance I join, Crisanta is always my go to Guitar to perform with.

        <br><br>

        In 2017, I bought my first violin which I named Alice. Just when I thought that learning guitar is hard. The violin is harder. It's such a blind instrument you had to really start from the basics from forms and positions to applicable techniques. Luckily without bargaining, I was able to go through learning it with my experience with the guitar and by having a sound sensitive ear to guide me on what I need to press on the fingerboard.

      title: Inspirations
      description: "When we say of inspiration, we think about the people who
        influenced us the most. My first inspiration was my Uncle Manny who was
        also my first guitar teacher back in 2007. He taught me all the basics I
        had to learn but ever since he left for Hongkong, I never got to talk to
        him again not until 2011 where I met him again to learn Major and Minor
        scales and the CAGED system, demonstrating how Chords can be shaped in
        different positions. In 2018, I managed to visit him again for Country
        Violin lessons and one of the best things I've learned was the Hokum
        Bowing and the Figure Eight for the \"Orange Blossom Special\".\ 

        <br><br>\r

        \r

        My Uncle Henry resides here in the Philippines, and he filled in
        the void what I lacked during my beginner days of learning guitar. In
        2009 I learned my first fingerpicking song from him entitled \"Dust in
        The Wind\", from there I was able too woo people with it as millennials
        in that time wasn't learning much songs from the olden days.

        <br><br>\r

        \r

        My Uncle Herby who was also affiliated with my Uncle Manny in
        Hongkong taught me the Blues and the Advanced Fingerpicking styles which
        I incorporated into my technique. But he wasn't just an ordinary guitar
        mentor, he was also a life mentor. And we talked about anything from
        Gigs to Real life  situations and what I can do with them."

              My Uncle Jojo was also crazy over New Wave music so

              At the time, the game \"Guitar Hero\" was a thing
              and we had this version of the game that played to 80s tracks
              which got me more excited and motivated to learn guitar, despite
              the genre being keyboard focused, I was always feeling hype into
              listening to these type of music."

              During 2008, she brought her Electric Guitar and it
              was my first time holding one. She taught me to play the Power
              Chords and for a beginner like me, I was really happy to think
              that it's easy since it's just the same shape for every chord in
              different positions.

              and Yellowcard. I was getting addicted to the point that I
              explored more and got me to having Green Day and Blink182 as my
              all time favorite bands.\

            description: "Classical Music was more like a come and go genre for me as I only
              get to enjoy it occasionally. I would only get to play it when I
              feel like it, but the lack of techniques I possessed and the
              complexity of the music style always leads me to give up easily
              and come back again when I feel like I'm ready to play it.\ 

              <br><br>\r

              \r

              My Mom was a classically trained singer in UST.
              Since I was a kid, besides her new wave tracks, she'd play some
              classical ones as well mostly from Bach and one of her favorite
              pieces \"Canon in D\" by Pachelbel.\ 

              <br><br>\r

              \r

              I loved some of the Classical stuff so much I had to
              force myself to learn one by ear. And that is \"Minuet in G
              Major\" by Bach which I learned in High School of 2009 and
              \"Canon\" in 2010."

            add_description: "By 2011 I was enrolled in Guitar Lessons in Greenhills to
              learn to read notes. It didn't last very long and I forgot almost
              everything I learned reading notes, but my Guitar Teacher ,Phil
              taught me to have discipline on plucking the strings alternately
              instead of having to pluck twice or thrice with one finger on a
              string.\r

              He also taught me how to shape your fingernails
              properly into producing a nice guitar string sound on a Nylon
              Guitar with the use of Nail Filers and Nail Buffers.

              <br><br>\r

              \r

              When Covid started and implementing lockdowns in
              2020, since gigs weren't available I was able to start playing
              Classical Music again but on the Violin. If learning Violin by ear
              was already a pain to you, it was even harder for me to play it
              while I read the notes on the music sheet. I usually pick up the
              flow of the piece by ear and had it memorized, which made it
              challenging for me as I had to train myself to play the piece as
              written in the sheet and not what is based on my memory. But
              eventually I was over that and got to do at least the basics of
              sightreading which nurtured my violin playing a bit more.

              <br><br>\r

              \r

              I love Classical Music but I believe it's far too
              late now to be indulged in it as I was already enrolled in a
              Computer Science Degree in College. And the best thing I could do
              is learn the basics and appreciate where Beautiful music of today
              really came from."

              My mind was so naïve to think that I know a lot of
              Music already not until I saw both my Uncles perform live Folk,
              Country and Rock N Roll music. It was exhilarating, the music
              style was entirely new to me, that I when I got home in Manila, I
              knew I had to update my personal playlist and learn learn some of

        Being in a band is also like being in a family, you treat each

              Manila is overrun too much by Rock, Reggae, Pop music. Filipino
              Millenials and Gen Zs often refer Country and Folk music as old
              music on which is something sad for me to hear and never knew how
