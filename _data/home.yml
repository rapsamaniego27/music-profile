feature_left_title: Former Band Leader
feature_left_description: I lead a band called Folk Ridge which specializes on
  Country, Folk and Rock n Roll music. It was a rough start but we managed to
  get the group established and find common people. I had a vision to make our
  preferred genres great again and introduce it to young gen and re-live the
  music into the oldies.
