    Hello fellow music enthusiasts! Thank you for dropping by and I am saluting
    you for taking a step forward into learning the ways of a musical guru. I
    both play the guitar and violin since 2007 and 2017 respectively. All I can
    say is that not a day goes by that I regret learning any instrument and how
    great a life companion they can be. Being able to share music to the world
    by plucking every string on the guitar, making listeners capture every
    melody with every bow strokes on the violin is my passion and perhaps the
    fiber of my being. 

    <br><br>

    Having said this, it my earnest desire to share this talent of mine to those who are willing to learn and enjoy the magic of music and its many rudiments and nuances. This is the first step to becoming a fully-realized musician.
