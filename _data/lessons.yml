    Hello fellow music enthusiast, thank you for dropping by and saluting you
    into taking a step forward into learning the ways of a Musical Jedi. I both
    play Guitar and Violin, 2007 and 2017 respectively. All I can say is that
    not a day goes by that I regret learning an instrument and how great of a
    life companion an instrument can be. Being able to share music to the world
    by plucking every string on the guitar, making  them capture every melody
    with every bow strokes on the violin. 

    <br><br>

    But what is talent if not shared to the eager people? What is talent if not played with? Whether you're a beginner or a more intermediate musician, it is my pleasure to help you practice and guide you what you need into becoming fully realized musician.

    The three steps into becoming a Musical Jedi are Theory, Technique and
    Application. Problem with some Online Video Tutorials is that they only get
    you what you want to achieve but not really 

    educating along the way how you got through all those Chords, those strumming, the reasons behind the chords, and how some songs are useful for your future performances. And you can be bombarded with all these information and not knowing where to start.

    <br><br>

    I will teach you and guide you every step of the way as you progress by starting with BASIC THEORY,  and understanding how some notes are related to each other, how it is formed with your fingers, concepts that are useful and we apply those concepts with practical TECHNIQUES on the instrument and APPLICATION by going through mini quizzes and jam sessions that are meant to be fun to do and understand how it fits some genres or musical styles.

    We forgot that learning shouldn't just be fun it also needs to be educational especially in the generation we are living in right now.
