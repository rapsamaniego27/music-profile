title: Busking Solo
description: >-
  E﻿ver since I was a kid I've always dreamed of being in a band. I got my first
  band in 2010, and since then I was always used to lots of musician
  collaborations. I always loved the roles we have to take, one doing lead
  guitar, the other doing the melody, one being low note puncher and one
  smashing and maintaining the rhythym.\

  \

  T﻿hings were going smooth until Pandemic struck and there was a global lockdown. 2 and a half years later, Music was back however, my motivation to be in a band wasn't. This is why I took leap into doing things alone. I tried collaborating with former band members, but I had a hard time getting back the same fire I had. So I took different direction and decided to do busking solo. \

  \

  I﻿ had a friendly encouragement from a fellow musician named Clarissa as she was pretty popular in the local busking scene. I started to appreciate myself more and allowed myself to explore other music. \

  \

  But there was only one problem. MY VOCAL RANGE WASN'T HIGH!

  \﻿

  \

  I﻿ never gave up as I kept researching and practicing, although my violin skills were going down, my sense of being independent in creating my own music was increasing. M﻿y loop pedal that was sitting in my closet for 3 years was used more now and I got to explore the skill of looping. It is truly a solo busker's ultimate pedal as it really helps out to give some kick in the performance.

  I﻿ then bought a cheap Reverb pedal called "Atmosphere" by Joyo.

  \﻿

  \﻿

  O﻿ne year later, I still do busking once a week and looking forward to grow with this. It is truly an enjoyable experience to showcase your talent to friendly people outside.

  better musician.
