  B﻿esides the fact that I love Music, I always find myself to indulge in Anime
  Series. 


  A﻿ttack on Titan is one of those shows that had me ignore it because of the naked creatures I was seeing in trailers or merchandises outside. But I kept hearing the buzz about this show and got me really intrigued about it. All I can say is that I enjoyed Season 1 to 3 very much. The mystery, action and drama just meshed so well in the story even though there's violins (if you know what I mean haha). \

  \

  W﻿hen Season 4 came, I was like "Huh? What's going on?" I learned that it became really serious but it explained everything that we love or even disliked about Season 1 to 3. Everything made sense and war was just something that went on and on. Now that its over, sometimes I find myself wanting for more of these kind of shows, hopefully I could find one.
