    <h2 class="bio-section__title">How It Started:</h2>
    <div class="bio-section__description">
      <p>
        It all started in my theatre workshop days in Repertory Philippines back in 2002. I was exposed to these
        Musicals
        and Broadway songs because of my Mother who was also Theatre and Vocal coach at the time. I did shows like the
        Lion
        King, Once on This Island, Mamma Mia and Thirteen the Musical, just to name a few.
        <br><br>
        When I reached 12 years old, Christmas Day on 2007. My mother bought me a Blue Nylon guitar from RJ Music store.
        At
        first, I didn't know what to do with it because I had no background whatsoever. But then we visited my Uncle
        Manny
        in Manila to teach me the basic Chords (D, G, A, C,E). I couldn't see the sense of the chords until I heard him
        play
        guitar in front of me using the said chords. As far as I remember he was playing a Spanish tune.
        <br><br>
        Once I got to learn a few chords, I got so overjoyed and had to learn chords of songs I enjoy listening to. Just
        like any other beginner, I had to stop on one song because of it's complexity and had to choose an easier one.
        At
        some point I had to stop for months, it was an on and off experience for me learning the guitar as I only had
        one
        lesson from my Uncle. I can't say also to myself that I'm self taught, I still manage to meet up with my Uncles
        just
        to have one day of special lessons. So it's like 80% self taught and 20% from personal and online tutorials.
        <br><br>
        I am Rap and I hope you enjoy my stories and experiences as you scroll down this page.

        <p>Janemist was my first ever band. I was thrilled when I got to watch my first ever Battle of the Bands
          competition in my 3rd year of High School. This started the motivation for me to build my own band as I was
          really fascinated to see people my age to be playing music on stage.
          <br><br>
          Each and every member of Janemist was part of a band at the time of the competition. When school year was
          over, I was lucky enough to approach Zyril (Drummer) to invite him to form a band and I was mind blown when I
          played with Genrei (Lead Guitarist) for a jam session in his house.
          <br><br>
          As time went by we were growing and invited Darwin, Jona, Gizette, Kisha and Emman to be part of the family.

        We were crazy over Green Day, Blink 182 and Paramore and played most of their songs in a small studio in
        Libertad,
        Mandaluyong. We were young, alive and dreaming to be professional musicians someday and we just kept on
        practicing
        until as we were ready for each competitions or events we joined. They were my first love, there's no such thing
        as
        forever but they always remain a special place in my musical journey.
